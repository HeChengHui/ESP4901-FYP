## Final Year Project - Target Tracking Using Camera For Unmanned System
This FYP is done in AY 2021/2022.   
  
Summary: The end goal is to formulate a Real-Time Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) Algorithm to be used in an embedded device called the DJI Manifold 2G, onboard a drone. However, due to challenges faced when integrating software with proprietary hardware (Manifold 2G), the hardware is changed to Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier to continue with the project. The Algorithm chosen was [YOLOv5+DeepSORT](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_OSNet). 


* YOLOv5 training information can be seen [here](https://wandb.ai/d3cpt).
* AGX installed with: Python3.8, Pytorch 1.7.0, Torchvision 0.8.1. (Mainly referred to this [link](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/install-pytorch-with-python-3-8-on-jetpack-4-4-1/160060/2))
